Mini project aims to design different kinds of neural networks for different applications
and observe their results. Mini project has 3 parts. In part 1, sparse autoencoder is designed to
obtain hidden feature extraction. Moreover, natural language structure is designed for predicting
the next word according to given input. Finally, sequential neural network models such as RNN,
LSTM and GRU designed to predict the movement.
